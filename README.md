# Employee Summary

This command line application is a software team generator that will prompt the user for information about the managers and the team members.
The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

The following demonstrates the application functionality:
